scala-utils
===========

scala-utils is a small collection of utilities for personal projects in Scala. At the moment it contains a smattering of helpful functions that I've used in various toy projects.

To Build
========

The scala-utils library is built with sbt *(version 12.14+)*. Simply clone the latest version of scala-utils from github, navigate to the project folder, and use the commands:

    > sbt
    > compile

The resulting jar will be generated in the target/scala-2.10/ directory.
